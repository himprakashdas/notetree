# PRD Generator

This skill guides you through creating a high-quality Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Workflow

1.  **Information Gathering**: Ask the user for the core idea, target audience, and key problems they are solving if not already provided.
2.  **Template Selection**: Use the standard PRD template found in [references/prd_template.md](references/prd_template.md).
3.  **Drafting**: Generate a detailed draft based on the user's input and the template.
4.  **Refinement**: Present the draft to the user and ask for feedback or missing details (e.g., success metrics, technical constraints).

## Guidelines

- **Be Thorough**: Don't just list features; explain the *why* behind them.
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure the goals align with the problem statement and the requirements support the goals.
- **Use Clear Language**: Avoid jargon where possible, or define it.
- **Iterative Process**: Encourage the user to fill in gaps in user stories or technical considerations.
