# Project: NoteTree

## Vision
A tree-based learning interface that solves "linear chat fatigue" by allowing users to branch conversations, maintaining context inheritance while isolating divergent lines of inquiry.

## Core Pillars
1. **Contextual Intelligence**: Ancestor-based inheritance with sibling isolation.
2. **Visual Clarity**: Infinite canvas with ghosting, folding, and semantic coloring.
3. **Desktop Power**: Optimized for high-fidelity interaction and large-scale knowledge mapping.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Deep Learners (Researchers, Developers, Students).
- **Secondary**: Power users of LLM interfaces.

## Current Status
- Initializing project. Codebase map generated. Tech stack selected.
