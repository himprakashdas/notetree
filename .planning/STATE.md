# Project State: NoteTree

## Current Phase: Phase 1 (Foundation)
**Status**: Executing Plan 01
**Progress**: 1/5 Plans
**Goal**: Establish the infinite canvas and persistence foundation.

## Completed Milestones
- [x] Codebase analysis and mapping.
- [x] Technical stack selection (Vite, React Flow, Zustand, Dexie).
- [x] Domain research on DAG state and context inheritance.
- [x] Project requirements defined.
- [x] High-level roadmap established.
- [x] Project Foundation & Persistence Setup (Plan 01).

## Active Tasks
- [x] Initialize Vite + React project.
- [ ] Scaffold React Flow + Zustand integration (Plan 02).

## Decisions
- [x] Use Tailwind 4 for CSS-first styling.
- [x] Use Repository pattern for Dexie DB access.

## Context Memory
- **Root Concept**: Tree-based LLM interaction to solve linear fatigue.
- **Key Constraint**: Desktop-first, local persistence (no server).
- **Inheritance Pattern**: Root + last N ancestors (Sliding Window).
- **Persistence Pattern**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js for large DAGs.

## Session Info
- **Last session**: 2024-02-13
- **Stopped at**: Completed Phase 1 Plan 01
