# Roadmap: NoteTree

## Phase 1: Foundation (Infinite Canvas & Persistence)
*Goal: Establish the visual workspace and local data storage.*
**Plans:** 5 plans
- [ ] phase-1-01-PLAN.md — Setup environment, Dexie, and flat-mapped Zustand store.
- [ ] phase-1-02-PLAN.md — Implement React Flow canvas and custom ChatNode.
- [ ] phase-1-03-PLAN.md — Core branching interaction and auto-pan logic.
- [ ] phase-1-04-PLAN.md — Chat overlay modal and real-time auto-save.
- [ ] phase-1-05-PLAN.md — Project Gallery and advanced node deletion.

## Phase 2: Core AI Integration (Branching & Context)
*Goal: Enable the core "Tree Learning" value proposition.*
- [ ] Integrate Gemini API client.
- [ ] Implement ancestor-based context inheritance logic.
- [ ] Build the "Branch" interaction (spawn child node from parent).
- [ ] Sequential request queueing to handle multiple AI calls.
- [ ] Basic token counting and error handling.

## Phase 3: Visual Management (Focus & Organization)
*Goal: Prevent "Tree Sprawl" and improve UI/UX.*
- [ ] Implement "Ghosting Mode" (dimming inactive lineages).
- [ ] Add Node folding/summarization (LLM-driven summaries).
- [ ] Implement "Visual Breadcrumbs" (navigation trail to root).
- [ ] Semantic coloring for nodes.

## Phase 4: Utilities & Refinement (Productivity)
*Goal: Enhance user efficiency and workflow.*
- [ ] "Copy Branch" feature (export lineage to Markdown).
- [ ] Multi-model support (OpenAI integration).
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Enter to branch, etc.).
- [ ] Performance optimization (viewport virtualization for 200+ nodes).

## Future Scope (Post-MVP)
- Branch merging.
- Session export/import (JSON/Markdown).
- Mobile "Drill-down" view.
- Real-time collaboration.
