# GEMINI Context: NoteTree
## Important instruction
Refer to `Spawned by` text in each agent inside `~/.gemini/agents/` and map all agents to`gsd:{tool-name}` 

## Directory Overview
This directory contains the initial conceptual documentation for **NoteTree**, a tree-based learning platform designed to improve interactions with LLMs (like ChatGPT or Gemini). The project aims to solve the "linear chat fatigue" where following up on specific points in a long conversation requires excessive scrolling and loss of context.

## Key Files
- **README.md**: Contains the core problem statement, project proposal, and the high-level vision for a tree-based branching chat interface.
- **GEMINI.md**: This file, providing context and guidance for AI-assisted development of the project.

## Usage
The contents of this directory are currently in the **ideation and planning phase**. They should be used as a reference for:
1.  Understanding the "NoteTree" concept: branching conversations where child nodes inherit parent context.
2.  Developing future project requirements and technical specifications.
3.  Bootstrapping the codebase (e.g., choosing a tech stack for a tree-based UI and backend context management).

## Development Goals (Future)
As the project transitions to a code project, the following should be defined:
-   **Tech Stack**: Selection of frontend (e.g., React/D3 for tree visualization) and backend (e.g., Node.js/Python) technologies.
-   **Context Management**: How context is propagated and shared between sibling and parent-child nodes in the tree.
-   **Integration**: How it will interface with LLM APIs.
